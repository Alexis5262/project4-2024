             <p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a novel written by Lewis Carroll, first published in 1865. It tells the story of a young girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world filled with peculiar creatures, strange characters, and absurd events. Throughout her journey, Alice encounters characters like the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts, each offering bizarre and often nonsensical wisdom. The story is celebrated for its playful use of logic, its exploration of dreams and identity, and its whimsical approach to storytelling. The novel has become a classic of children's literature and is known for its surreal, imaginative landscapes and its blend of fantasy and wordplay.</p>
